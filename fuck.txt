‚ö†Ô∏è TERMS OF USE AND SERVICE ‚ö†Ô∏è

 Our application is an internet provider via VPN. Please be aware that VPN is not Wi-Fi. THE FEATURE TO WORK GAMES AND INTERNET CALLS ARE ACTIVE, BUT THERE IS NO WAY TO GUARANTEE AN EXPERIENCE AS GOOD AS WI-FI. If you want to always play with ping below 100, watch in 4K or download large files via torrent, hire a Wi-Fi service from a local internet provider!!!  
 
 üåÄ ABOUT SUPPORT: 
 We teach you how to use our application. If the service stops working, it may be because the server is congested or there is a problem with the operator's local network. Contact us so we can check and fix it (if the problem is with our server). It may also be because the problem is with the operator's own network (as is most of the time). Slowness, network maintenance, operator connection method failure, etc. If this is the case, we will not be able to help. We are not responsible for instabilities in the operator's network that cause slowness and crashes in internet access via VPN. We do not block services, apps, games or websites, so we are also not responsible if any online service, application or website does not work due to their VPN access being blocked. 
 
 üåÄ WHAT GUARANTEES DO THE CUSTOMER AND RESELLER HAVE? 
 
  We guarantee that the contracted service will be valid for 30 days (it will only stop working before this period if the connection method is blocked by the operator). Our commitment is to keep the server active and configured correctly to make the connection as stable as possible. Remembering again about the connection, any operator can block it and the system will no longer work in certain states, and sometimes even in all states (as has happened before). This is beyond our control. If it goes down, everyone loses. Those who bought access, resellers, server owners lose their investment in server structure, website hosting, domain, private CDN, etc. Those who buy, buy knowing that it can go down. 
  
 üåÄ RULES TO FOLLOW üåÄ 
 
 Among the rules for using the service, we have only a few restrictions. 1 - Do not exceed the contracted limit. If you contracted for 1 device, use only 1 device. If you bought for 2 devices, use it on 2. And so on. 2 - The use of Client Torrents or P2P is not permitted.  3 - It is not permitted to use this service to carry out D-DoS attacks or any other type of malicious hacker attack on third-party servers or websites. 4 - Carding, approvals or any cybercrimes are not permitted. 
 
 ‚ö†Ô∏è If any of the above rules are found to be in breach, your access may be deleted without prior notice and without any right to a refund or login creation. Furthermore, you are free to use any other use of this service! Have a great browsing experience!!! 
 
 TO AVOID PROBLEMS, DO NOT BUY WITHOUT TESTING IT FIRST. IF YOU BUY WITHOUT TESTING IT AND THE SERVICE DOES NOT WORK IN YOUR REGION, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL YOU BE REFUNDED THE TOTAL OR PARTIAL AMOUNT OF THE PURCHASE!!!
